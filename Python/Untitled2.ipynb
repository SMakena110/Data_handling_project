    "#### REPORT ON THE ESTIMATION OF OBESITY LEVELS BASED ON DIETARY AND PHYSICAL HABITS\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation** :The dataset contained 2,111 records across 17 features, including demographic, physical, dietary, and activity data. Key steps in preparing the data were: \n",
    "- **Completeness**: All fields had non-null values.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**: Duplicate entries (42 records) were removed, leaving 2,069 clean records. Inconsistent column naming conventions were standardized. \n",
    "- **Handling Outliers**: Weight outliers were addressed through capping between the 15th and 85th percentiles, normalizing weight distribution. \n",
    "- **Normalization:** Continuous variables (age, weight, height, physical activity frequency, etc.) were normalized using Min-Max Scaling to facilitate model performance and feature comparability. Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded into numerical formats using LabelEncoder for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overview of Data Exploration Statistics and Trends**\r",
    "- **\n",
    "Demographic**s: The collection was dominated by younger people, with normalized age values centered around 0.2. Bimodality of the weight distribution, with maxima for obese and underweight/normal-weight people, indicates a polarized dataset.- **\r\n",
    "Distribution of Heig**ht: Clustering was probably impacted by age, gender, or ethnicity- **.\r\n",
    "Food Routi**n s:\r\n",
    "The high frequency of vegetable consumption suggested health-conscious behavio- **rs.\r\n",
    "Meal Pat**terns: It was rare for people to nibble in between meals; most people ate three meals a - **day.\r\n",
    "Water **Intake: The average person drank two liters every- ** day.\r\n",
    "Physical A**ctivity: Sedentary people were distinguished from groups that were moderately active by a bimodal distrib- **ution.\r\n",
    "Techno**logy Use: There was a sizable fraction that used technology moderately, and higher physical activity was associated with lower t\n",
    "- **Transportation**: Using a car was linked to heavier weights, but active modes like walking or cycling were linked to healthier weights.\r",
    "- **\n",
    "The correlation**: \r\n",
    "There was a significant positive connection between height and weight (0.6â€“0.7).\r\n",
    "There was a considerable correlation between the amount of time spent exercising and its frequenc- **y.\r\n",
    "Connections to Obesity Le**: els\r\n",
    "Obesity levels were linked to high-calorie meals and family history.\r\n",
    "Although outliers continued to occur among calorie-tracking people, calorie monitoring demonstrated a protective effect.\r\n",
    "The effects of alcohol intake were varied, with moderate drinkers showing more balanced weights than regular or abstinent dr\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understanding how dietary practices affect obesity**:\r",
    "\r\n",
    "Obesity is closely associated with high-calorie meals, but risks are reduced by regular vegetable eating and sufficient water intake.\r\n",
    "Unusual snacking and eating habits lead to weight gai- **n.\r\n",
    "Lifestyle and Physical Acti**v y:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "One of the main causes of obesity is sedentary lifestyles, which include little exercise and excessive tech use.\r\n",
    "Walking, cycling, and other active transportation techniques support the maintenance of healthy we- **ights.\r\n",
    "Behavior and Environmental**  ctors:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Obesity rates are influenced by family history and socioeconomic factors, including mode of transportation and alc- **ohol use.\r\n",
    "Trends**   Obesity:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A significant number of people fit into high-obesity categories, indicating structural problems with nutrition a\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Suggestions for Public Health Initiatives**:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Encourage the eating of more vegetables and fewer calorie-dense items in balanced diets.\r\n",
    "Increase knowledge about drinking enough water as an affordable way to reduce obesity.\r\n",
    "Initiatives for Physical Activity:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Promote the use of active transportation and incorporate exercise into everyday activities.\r\n",
    "Encourage inactive people to take up moderate exercise by offering incentives.\r\n",
    "Sedentary behavior and technology:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Encourage less time spent on screens and active breaks when engaging in sedentary pursuits.\r\n",
    "Urban planning and policy:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Encourage urban design that promotes active transportation, such as bike lanes.\r\n",
    "Put limits or taxes on items that are high in calories but low\n",
    "- **Tailored Interventions**:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Offer specialized interventions to people who have a family history of obesity or certain eating habits.\r\n",
    "Observation and Investigation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Monitor changes in obesity measures at the population level to assess the efficacy of interventions.\r\n",
    "Do further research on how culture affects eating patterns and obesity.\r\n",
    "5. Assessment of the Model\r\n",
    "With a test accuracy of 93%, Random Forest outpelformed Lrgistic Regression (74%).\r\n",
    "Dietary practices, physical activity, and demographic characteristics were identified as the main predictors of obesity by feature importance.\r\n",
    "The complex nature of obesity was emphasized by both models; nevertheless, additional refinement and cross-validation are suggested to improve general\r\n",
